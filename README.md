- this lab is about creating a job tracker website using the firebase cloud storage database, all the users and job applications that users add are stored in the firebase cloud storage.

- this website contains a register page and a login page, and a dashboard that contains filtered job applications where users can filter , and add new applications, also a profile page where the user can see his data on it

- and an admin page for admins where admin can review job applications.

    - also we have included an Ai Job analyzer where you can paste any job description , and it will give you the key skills and recommended keywords

    - and also there is a chatbot where you can chat with him about career guidance

    - also we have created a job Insights were it tells you the count of jobs you applied to and the count of interviews and how many are rejected and hired

    - also we generate a motivational summary about your job search progress

    - In the last version of this lab I used the nodeJs/express as the backend to handle the api requests and connected
    the server to the backend so if you want to start the backend server you have to start it by typing "node server.js"

    - and also you have to type "npm start" so you can also run the front end part, and I used firebase for the cloud storage
